        Uses the specified bulk send list to send the envelope specified in the payload
        This method initiates the bulk send process. It generates a bulk send request based on an [existing bulk send list][create_list] and an envelope or template.  Consider using the [BulkSend::createBulkSendTestRequest][create_test] method to test your bulk send list for compatibility with the envelope or template that you want to send first. To learn about the complete bulk send flow, see the [Bulk Send overview][BulkSendOverview].  If the envelopes were successfully queued for asynchronous processing, the response contains a `batchId` that you can use to get the status of the batch. If a failure occurs, the API returns an error message.  **Note:** Partial success or failure generally does not occur. Only the entire batch is queued for asynchronous processing.  ### Related topics  - [How to bulk send envelopes](/docs/esign-rest-api/how-to/bulk-send-envelopes/)   ### Errors  This method returns the following errors:  | Error code                                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | | :--------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | BULK_SEND_ENVELOPE_NOT_IN_SENDABLE_STATE                   | Envelope {0} is not in a sendable state.

        Uses the specified bulk send list to send the envelope specified in the payload
        This method initiates the bulk send process. It generates a bulk send request based on an [existing bulk send list][create_list] and an envelope or template.  Consider using the [BulkSend::createBulkSendTestRequest][create_test] method to test your bulk send list for compatibility with the envelope or template that you want to send first. To learn about the complete bulk send flow, see the [Bulk Send overview][BulkSendOverview].  If the envelopes were successfully queued for asynchronous processing, the response contains a `batchId` that you can use to get the status of the batch. If a failure occurs, the API returns an error message.  **Note:** Partial success or failure generally does not occur. Only the entire batch is queued for asynchronous processing.  ### Related topics  - [How to bulk send envelopes](/docs/esign-rest-api/how-to/bulk-send-envelopes/)   ### Errors  This method returns the following errors:  | Error code                                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | | :--------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | BULK_SEND_ENVELOPE_NOT_IN_SENDABLE_STATE                   | Envelope {0} is not in a sendable state.

        Tests whether the specified bulk sending list can be used to send an envelope
        This method tests a bulk send list for compatibility with the envelope or template that you want to send. For example, a template that has three roles is not compatible with a bulk send list that has only two recipients. For this reason, you might want to test compatibility first.  A successful test result returns `true` for the `canBeSent` property. An unsuccessful test returns a JSON response that contains information about the errors that occurred.  If the test is successful, you can then send the envelope or template by using the [BulkSend::createBulkSendRequest][BulkSendRequest] method.  ## Envelope Compatibility Checks  This section describes the envelope compatibility checks that the system performs.  **Top-Level Issues**  - Envelopes must be in a sendable state. - The bulk send list must contain at least one copy (instance of an envelope), and no more than the maximum number of copies allowed for the account. - The envelope must not be null and must be visible to the current user. - The account cannot have more queued envelopes than the maximum number configured for the account. - The bulk send list must exist.  **Recipients**  - The envelope must have recipients. - If you are using an envelope, all of the recipients defined in the bulk send list must have corresponding recipient IDs in the envelope definition. If you are using a template, you must either match the recipient IDs or role IDs. - The envelope cannot contain a bulk recipient (an artifact of the legacy version of DocuSign's bulk send   functionality).  **Recipient Tabs**  - Every `recipient ID, tab label` pair in the bulk send list must correspond to a tab in the envelope.  **Custom Fields**  - Each envelope-level custom field in the bulk send list must correspond to the name of a `customField` in the   envelope definition. You do not have to match the recipient-level custom fields.  [BulkSendRequest]:  /docs/esign-rest-api/reference/bulkenvelopes/bulksend/createbulksendrequest/
